        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Components of NLP</h2>
        
        <h3>Tokenization</h3>
        <p>
            Breaking down text into smaller units such as words or sentences.
        </p>

        <h3>Part-of-Speech Tagging</h3>
        <p>
            Identifying the grammatical category of words in a sentence.
        </p>

        <h3>Named Entity Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            Identifying proper names such as people, organizations, and locations in text.
        </p>

        <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in text.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications of NLP</h2>

        <h3>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants</h3>
        <p>
            NLP powers chatbots and AI assistants like Siri and Alexa to understand and respond to user queries.
        </p>

        <h3>Machine Translation</h3>
        <p>
            Enables automatic translation between languages, such as Google Translate.
        </p>

        <h3>Speech Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            Converts spoken language into text, as seen in voice-controlled applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Text Summarization</h3>
        <p>
            Automatically generates concise summaries of large texts.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges in NLP</h2>

        <h3>Ambiguity</h3>
        <p>
            Words and sentences often have multiple meanings, making interpretation difficult.
        </p>

        <h3>Context Understanding</h3>
        <p>
            Machines struggle to fully grasp contextual and cultural nuances in language.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>
            NLP models require vast amounts of high-quality data for accurate performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Future of NLP</h2>
        <p>
            With advancements in deep learning and neural networks, NLP is becoming more sophisticated, enabling more natural and human-like interactions between people and machines.
