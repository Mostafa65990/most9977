        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <img src="CV.jpeg" alt="Computer Vision">
        <p>
            Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. 
            It involves techniques for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and making decisions based on digital images or videos.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Computer Vision</h2>
        <h3>Image Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Image processing involves manipulating images to enhance their quality or extract useful information. Techniques include filtering, edge detection, and noise reduction.
        </p>
        <h3>Object Detection</h3>
        <p>
            Object detection enables computers to recognize and locate objects in an image or video. Applications include face recognition, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Image Classification</h3>
        <p>
            Image classification assigns labels to images based on their content. This is used in medical diagnosis, quality control, and content moderation.
        </p>

        <h2>Applications of Computer Vision</h2>
        <h3>Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
            In healthcare, Computer Vision assists in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, and detecting abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
        </p>
        <h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
        <p>
            Self-driving cars use Computer Vision to detect objects, interpret road signs, and navigate safely without human intervention.
        </p>
        <h3>Security and Surveillance</h3>
        <p>
            Facial recognition, anomaly detection, and automated monitoring systems enhance security in public spaces and private establishments.
        </p>
        <h3>Retail and E-commerce</h3>
        <p>
            Computer Vision is used for virtual try-ons, cashier-less stores, and product recommendation systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Ethical Concerns</h2>
        <h3>Bias and Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
            AI models can be biased based on the training data, leading to inaccuracies in facial recognition and classification tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy Issues</h3>
        <p>
            The use of surveillance cameras and facial recognition raises concerns about personal privacy and data security.
        </p>
        <h3>Computational Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            Processing large amounts of visual data requires significant computational power, making real-time applications challenging.
        </p>

        <h2>The Future of Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Advances in deep learning, 3D vision, and AI-powered imaging will continue to push the boundaries of Computer Vision applications, leading to smarter automation and improved real-world interactions.
